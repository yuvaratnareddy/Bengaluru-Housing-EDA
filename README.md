# 📊 Bengaluru Housing Price Analysis (Exploratory Data Analysis)

---

## 🔹 Project Overview

This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Bengaluru housing dataset using Python. The goal is to clean, analyze, and visualize housing data to understand pricing trends and identify key factors influencing property prices.

EDA helps transform raw datasets into meaningful insights that support data-driven decision making in real estate analytics.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand housing price distribution
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing
- Analyze relationships between housing features
- Identify factors affecting property prices
- Create visualizations to uncover patterns
- Generate actionable insights

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Jupyter Notebook**

## 🔄 EDA Workflow

The project follows a structured Exploratory Data Analysis workflow:

### 1️⃣ Data Loading
- Imported dataset using Pandas
- Verified dataset dimensions and column information

### 2️⃣ Data Understanding
- Used `.info()` and `.describe()` for statistical summary
- Identified numerical and categorical features
- Checked feature distributions

### 3️⃣ Data Cleaning
- Handled missing values
- Removed duplicate records
- Fixed inconsistent data entries
- Converted data types where necessary

### 4️⃣ Exploratory Analysis
- Analysed price distribution across locations
- Studied relationships between area, bedrooms, and price
- Compared categorical variables affecting housing prices

### 5️⃣ Data Visualization
Visualizations created include:
- Histograms for distribution analysis
- Box plots for outlier detection
- Scatter plots for relationship analysis
- Bar charts for comparison analysis

### 6️⃣ Insight Generation
- Identified major price-influencing factors
- Detected location-based price variations
- Derived insights from visual trends

## 📊 Key Insights

- Housing prices vary significantly across locations, showing strong geographical influence.
- Larger properties generally have higher prices, indicating a positive relationship between size and cost.
- Some locations contain price outliers representing premium housing markets.
- Data preprocessing was essential due to inconsistencies in area and pricing values.
- Visualization helped uncover patterns useful for real estate market understanding.

EDA demonstrates how raw housing data can be transformed into actionable business intelligence.
